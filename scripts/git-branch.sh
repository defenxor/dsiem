Use the following as 1st argument:
  start        : creates a new temporary branch in local and remote repo. You will then use this branch during
                 development before submitting pull request, and to push improvements during the PR review process.
  commit       : commit your changes to the local branch.
  push         : push your committed changes to the remote branch. This shall trigger a CI build-test job unless 
                 a "[skip ci]" text is added to one of the commit messages.
  sync         : merge changes from master (if any) to your working branch, so you dont develop on top of an outdated
                 copy of master.
  ci-status    : view github status checks of the latest commit you push on the branch.
  pull-request : create a pull-request on github, which will start the build-test CI job and review process.
                 you can add more commits and pushes to update the PR based on review feedbacks or CI test results.
  cleanup      : after the PR has been merged (either by maintainers or bot), you can use this to delete the local 
                 working and remote branch.
