# Required fields:
#   timestamp (date), title (string), sensor (string), product (string), dst_ip (string), src_ip (string)
#
# For PluginRule type plugin, the following are also required:
#   plugin_id (integer), plugin_sid (integer)
#
# For TaxonomyRule type plugin, the following is also required:
#   category (string)
#
# Optional fields:
# These fields are optional but should be included whenever possible since they can be used in directive rules:
#   dst_port (integer), src_port (integer), protocol (string), subcategory (string)
#
# These fields are also optional and can be used in directive rules. They should be used for custom data that
# are not defined in standard SIEM fields.
#   custom_label1 (string), custom_data1 (string), custom_label2 (string), custom_data2 (string)
#   custom_label3 (string), custom_data3 (string)
#
# And this field is optional, and should be included if the original logs are also stored in elasticsearch.
# This will allow direct pivoting from alarm view in the web UI to the source index.
#   src_index_pattern (string)
#
# As for other fields from source log, they will be removed by logstash plugin prune below
