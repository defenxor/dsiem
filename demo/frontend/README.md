# Dsiem Demo â€” Frontend

Elastic UI framework app that combines all Dsiem features and integrations in a single interface.

## Usage

Full usage requires a [`docker-compose.yml`](../docker/docker-compose.yml) that defines all the other components: ELK, filebeat, APM, ossec, suricata, dsiem, wise, nesd, and a web server that is vulnerable to Shellshock exploit.

But for development purposes, just:

```shell
$ cd web && npm install && npm start
```

The web app should be available at `http://localhost:9000`

## Building

Requirements:

- NPM
- Docker

Building just the web app:

```shell
$ cd web && npm install && npm run build
```

Building the docker image:

```shell
$ ./build.sh
```
